# OpenCode Commands Collection

A comprehensive collection of useful custom commands for common development tasks. These commands work with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) to streamline your workflow.

## üìã Overview

Custom commands let you create shortcuts for repetitive tasks. Each command can:

- Run shell commands and capture output
- Reference files in your project
- Accept arguments
- Invoke specific agents
- Use different models

## üöÄ Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Install all commands globally:

```bash
# If you cloned the agents repository
cd agents

# Create the OpenCode command directory (if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/command/

# Copy all commands to your global OpenCode config
cp command/*.md ~/.config/opencode/command/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.config/opencode/command/
```

### Per-Project Installation

Install commands for specific projects:

```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .opencode/command/

# Copy all commands or select individual ones
cp /path/to/agents/command/*.md .opencode/command/

# Or copy just specific commands
cp /path/to/agents/command/test.md .opencode/command/
cp /path/to/agents/command/review.md .opencode/command/
```

### Installing Individual Commands

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/command/

# Download a specific command
curl -o ~/.config/opencode/command/test.md \
