Help me debug: $ARGUMENTS

Debugging process:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Clarify what's not working
2. **Reproduce**: Steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Error Messages**: Analyze error output or unexpected behavior
4. **Potential Causes**: List possible root causes
5. **Investigation**: Check relevant code, logs, or configuration
6. **Solution**: Provide specific fixes with code examples
7. **Testing**: Verify the fix works

Ask clarifying questions if needed:

- What is the expected behavior?
- What actually happens?
- When did this start happening?
- Any recent changes that might be related?

If error logs are available, include them:
!`npm run dev 2>&1 | head -50 || echo "Provide error details"`

Provide a step-by-step solution with clear explanations.
